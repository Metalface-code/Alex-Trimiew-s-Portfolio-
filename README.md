# Recomendations 
 According to the data it would be better for the busness to invest less in seafoods and meats due to low demand. I believe the next natural step in our study could be conducted on the dietary practices and lifestyles of the consumers to see if there is I high demand for vegan friendly products or more eco friendly products.
