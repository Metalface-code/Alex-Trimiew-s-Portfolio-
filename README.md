# Sales Predictions Data 

## Grocery stores and the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in predicting sales.

#### By Alexander Trimiew

The Issue we are tackling in this Data is to identify the trends in sales due to a number of different factors 
in the Sales Predictions Final Evaluations Dataset 

### The Data

 The goal of this is to help the retailer understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in predicting sales.
 
 # Model 
  
  The models that wer used in the final dataset were The model was evaluated usuing Linear Reggression and a simple simple regression tree model. 
  
  # Recomendation 
 
 I would implement the decision tree model becuase the testing seemed to have less overfitting values and made for a better model for predicting the item sales
  
  # Limitations and recomended steps moving forward
  
  The data itself had alot of values that had to be reomoved for linear regression to work due to them being irrelavant to the goal of finding sales numbers and what manipulates them. I would recomend making a new collection of data with categories that specifically meet the needs of looking for what drives sales and keeping out any data that is irrelavant to this that would make it more difficult for the machine learning models to predict what we are looking for
